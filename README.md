# CNNArchitectures
This notebook is focused on comparing between convolutional neural networks architectures. 
It is destined to be run under Google Colab since it is loading quite heavy models and doing a little bit of training as well.

# Content of this notebook
In this notebook you will first find a quick remainder about Convolutional Neural Network and a description of the layers that will be used.
Then, we will discuss about architectures in general and even build and train a custom architecture from scratch using Keras.
Later on you will find an overview of classic architectures that we will describe then compare.
Finally, you will be able to play with those architectures in order to classify your own images !
